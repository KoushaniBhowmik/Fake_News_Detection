## Installation Instructions ⚙️
### 1. Install Python and pip 🐍
- Download and install Python (version 3.8 or higher) from python.org.
- During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" option.
#### Verify installation:
```bash
- python --version
- pip --version
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries Manually 📚
```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install nltk
```

---

## Download required NLTK resources inside your Python environment:
```bash
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

---

## How to Run the Application Locally 🖥️
- After installing all dependencies, inside your cmd:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## It will automatically open in your web browser at:
- http://localhost:digits
- Input news text → Click Predict → See Result, Confidence Score, and Explanation!

---

## Deployment Instructions ☁️
- You can easily deploy this application using Streamlit Community Cloud:
- Push all project files to a GitHub repository.
- Go to Streamlit Cloud and sign in.
- Click "New App", select your GitHub repository.
- Select the main Python file (app.py).
- Click Deploy!
- You will get a public HTTPS link to share your app with everyone.

## Project Structure 🗂️
```bash
├── app.py               # Main Streamlit app
├── model.pkl            # Saved ML model
├── vectorizer.pkl       # Saved ML model
├── dataset/             # Folder containing datasets
├── css/                 # Custom CSS files
```

## Important Notes ✍️
### Model Updates:
- If you modify or retrain the ML model in Colab or elsewhere:
- Export a new .pkl file.
- Replace the old model.pkl in the project.

### Dataset Size:
If your dataset is too large, Streamlit Cloud might restrict uploads (limit ~100MB).

### Path Settings:
Ensure all file paths are relative (not absolute) for smooth deployment.

### License 📄
This project is open-source for educational and research purposes only.
